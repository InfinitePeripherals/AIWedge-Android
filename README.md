# AIWedge-Android

AIWedge is a versatile Android app that captures barcode scans and images, transmitting them to target applications via keystrokes or intents. It allows users to configure settings, customize barcode processing through JavaScript, and manage the app through QR codes, intents, or mobile device management (MDM) solutions. Key features include a barcode service, multiple output modes (keyboard and intent), and advanced configuration options like MagicFilters for enhanced data handling.
